This Python-based study planner helps students organize their revision schedule leading up to their exams. The program automatically generates a personalized study plan for the next 14 days, allocating time for each subject based on urgency (how close the exam is). Once a subject's exam date has passed, it is automatically removed from the study plan, and no further study time is allocated for that subject.
